# Django Headers
You will be creating a Django application that gives the client information about the request it made.

## Requirements
Start a new Django project from scratch.  Of course you should be using a fresh virtual environment.

In that project you should create an app called `django_headers`. `django_headers` should return a properly-formatted HTML document containing information about the client's [request](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/request-response/).

Choose a few headers and a few attributes that Django sets, and inject that information into a template.

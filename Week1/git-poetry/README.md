# Git Poetry
You might be a programmer, but there's no reason you can't express your artistic side.  

You will get to practice doing some basic things on the command line, and go through the git cycle that you will see over and over again.  

## Instructions
1. Fork this repository, so that your Github account has its own copy.
2. Clone <i>your forked repository</i> somewhere sensible on your machine.  
3. Using the command line, add a verse to the poem.<br/>
HINT:  `echo "A buggy program lacking any tests" >> ParadiseEdited.txt`
4. Feel free to add more lines if the Muses are speaking to you.
5. `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes.
6. Make a pull request.

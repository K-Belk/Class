# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description
Write a class that represents a game of tic-tac-toe, playable on the console.

### Requirements
You are free to design the game however you like, but here are some initial suggestions:
- Your class should store a representation of a board.  What data structure should you use?
- Your class should be able to display the current state of the board.
- Your class should be able to get user input to make a move.
- Your class should be able to determine when the game is over.  Your program should exit accordingly.

NOTE: To keep things simple, let's say that a win is three in a row horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).

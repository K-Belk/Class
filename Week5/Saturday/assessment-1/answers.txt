1. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable? What does `self.ATTRIBUTE` give you the ability to do that `ATTRIBUTE` does not?

    Your answer: 
    A class variable is the same across all instances of the class and if changed it changes for all instances. Where a instance variable is local to just that instance and doesn't interact with other instances.


2. List and describe all the `git` commands you commonly use to create a pull request

    Your answer: 'git add .' - stages files that have changed for commit
    'git commit -m'<commit message>'' - like a save point, a place you can go back to 
    'git push origin master' - 'git push' pushes up to your repository. 'origin master'  is where it is pushing in the repository

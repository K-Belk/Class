Create a dictatory to hold currency names and values
take the difference of the cost and paid to get change amount needed
loop through the currency dictatory checking if the change amount is greater than the value, starting from most valuable currency to the lowest.
store the amount of times the value goes into the change amount to determine how many to return.
subtract from the change needed and continue looping till change amount == 0
